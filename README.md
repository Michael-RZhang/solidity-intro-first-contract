# Intro to Solidity & Writing/Deploying your First Contract

For Oakland Blockchain Developers: A class going over the basics of the solidity language &amp; developing/deploying your first contract. Video coming soon.

**October 2017**: Web3 1.0 is only in beta so I made two versions of the instructions. In the talk I walk though the beta information, figuring I'd rather be working forward than backward. If you want to follow along with me
  - (Web3 v1.0-beta Instructions)[https://github.com/rachel-ftw/solidity-intro-first-contract/blob/master/walkthrough-web3-1.0beta.md].
    * [Web3 1.0 BETA Documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/index.html)
  -  (Web3 v1.9 Instructions)[https://github.com/rachel-ftw/solidity-intro-first-contract/blob/master/walkthrough-web3-0.19.0.md]
    * [Older Web3 Documentation](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)

Shout out to [Decypher](decypher.tv), got the 0.19 version instructions from him. His videos are awesome, I'd strongly recommend checking him out!





#### Adding clear to node console
I like adding this to my node console when I'm working. Then you can call the `clear` function and it will move all text to top of screen.
```js
function clear() {
  process.stdout.write('\u001B[2J\u001B[0;0f');
}
```
